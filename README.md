# LLM Launcher ðŸš€

LLM Launcher is a simple LLM testing tool allowing you to quickly test a single prompt across multiple models. 

You can use LLM Launcher right now @ https://llmlauncher.com or you can self host the application with docker by running: 

```
docker run -p 8501:8501 cbattlegear/llmlauncher
```

Either way you use it all of your data and settings are kept locally and only used to run the models.
